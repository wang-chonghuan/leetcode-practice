/**
 * Example 2: 239. Sliding Window Maximum
 *
 * Given an integer array nums and an integer k,
 * there is a sliding window of size k
 * that moves from the very left to the very right.
 * For each window, find the maximum element in the window.
 *
 * For example, given nums = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7], k = 3, return [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]. The first window is [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7] and the last window is [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7]
